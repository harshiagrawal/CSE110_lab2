          <p> My name is Harshi Agrawal, and I am a 3rd year CS student at UCSD. I am excited to learn HTML and I am making this site for my CSE 110 class.
          As part of my extracurriculars on campus, I am a social chair member on Women in Computing's board. 
          I am also an employee on campus at Canyonview Aquatic Center and in Delta Gamma.</p>
